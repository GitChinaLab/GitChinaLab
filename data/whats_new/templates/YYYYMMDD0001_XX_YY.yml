# This is a template for a "Whats New" release.
# A release typically contains multiple entries of features that we'd like to highlight.
#
# Below is an example of what a single entry should look like, it's required attributes,
# and what types we expect those attribute values to be. All attributes are required.
#
# For more information please refer to the handbook documentation here:
# https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/index.html#create-mr-for-whats-new-entries

# Please delete this line and above before submitting your merge request.

- title: # Match the release post entry
  body: | # Do not modify this line, instead modify the lines below.
    <!-- START OF BODY COMMENT

    This area supports markdown.

    It is recommended to copy and paste the release post entry content here.

    You can shorten it if needed, but remember that the entry itself has already been reviewed by Tech Writing so don't feel like you need to reword anything.

    Delete this entire comment and replace it with your markdown content.
