        # A special helper is required for partitioning because Postgres does not support concurrently building indexes
        # on partitioned tables. This helper concurrently adds the same index to each partition, and creates the final
        # index on the parent table once all of the partitions are indexed. This is the recommended safe way to add
        # indexes to partitioned tables.
        #
        # Example:
        #
        #     add_concurrent_partitioned_index :users, :some_column

        # Safely removes an existing index from a partitioned table. The method name is a bit inaccurate as it does not
        # drop the index concurrently, but it's named as such to maintain consistency with other similar helpers, and
        # indicate that this should be safe to use in a production environment.
        #
        # In current versions of Postgres it's impossible to drop an index concurrently, or drop an index from an
        # individual partition that exists across the entire partitioned table. As a result this helper drops the index
        # from the parent table, which automatically cascades to all partitions. While this does require an exclusive
        # lock, dropping an index is a fast operation that won't block the table for a significant period of time.
