    A breaking change will occur for the Runner [API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/runners.html#runners-api) endpoints in 15.0.

    Instead of the GitLab Runner API endpoints returning `offline` and `not_connected` for runners that have not contacted the GitLab instance in the past three months, the API endpoints will return the `stale` value, which was introduced in 14.6.
