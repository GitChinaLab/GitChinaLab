This folder contains helpers to be used in specs (and the specs for the helpers itself).
There is a convenient alias of `helpers/`, so files in this folder (e.g. `wait_for_promises`) can be imported
with `helpers/wait_for_promises`. 

If you are writing a spec for `~/helpers` application code, please place it in [helpers](../helpers).
