# X-Backend-Server header exposes server information

## Description

The target website returns the `X-Backend-Server` header which includes potentially internal/hidden IP addresses
or hostnames. By exposing these values, attackers may attempt to circumvent security proxies and access these
hosts directly.

## Remediation

Consult your proxy/load balancer documentation or provider on how to disable revealing the
`X-Backend-Server` header value.
