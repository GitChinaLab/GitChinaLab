      <<~DESCRIPTION
        GitLab CI/CD is a tool built into GitLab for software development through the [continuous methodologies](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/introduction/index.html#introduction-to-cicd-methodologies):

        * Continuous Integration (CI)
        * Continuous Delivery (CD)
        * Continuous Deployment (CD)

        Continuous Integration works by pushing small changes to your applicationâ€™s codebase hosted in a Git repository, and, to every push, run a pipeline of scripts to build, test, and validate the code changes before merging them into the main branch.

        Continuous Delivery and Deployment consist of a step further CI, deploying your application to production at every push to the default branch of the repository.

        These methodologies allow you to catch bugs and errors early in the development cycle, ensuring that all the code deployed to production complies with the code standards you established for your app.
