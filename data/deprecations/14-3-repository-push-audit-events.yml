    Audit events for [repository events](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/audit_events.html#repository-push) are now deprecated and will be removed in GitLab 15.0.

    These events have always been disabled by default and had to be manually enabled with a
    feature flag. Enabling them can cause too many events to be generated which can
    dramatically slow down GitLab instances. For this reason, they are being removed.
