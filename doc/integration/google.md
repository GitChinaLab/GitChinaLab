# Google OAuth 2.0 OmniAuth Provider **(FREE SELF)**

To enable the Google OAuth 2.0 OmniAuth provider you must register your application
with Google. Google generates a client ID and secret key for you to use.

## Enable Google OAuth

In Google's side:

1. Navigate to the [cloud resource manager](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-resource-manager) page
1. Select **Create Project**
1. Provide the project information:
   - **Project name** - "GitLab" works just fine here.
   - **Project ID** - Must be unique to all Google Developer registered applications.
     Google provides a randomly generated Project ID by default. You can use
     the randomly generated ID or choose a new one.
1. Refresh the page and you should see your new project in the list
1. Go to the [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/dashboard)
1. Select the previously created project in the upper left corner
1. Select **Credentials** from the sidebar
1. Select **OAuth consent screen** and fill the form with the required information
1. In the **Credentials** tab, select **Create credentials > OAuth client ID**
1. Fill in the required information
   - **Application type** - Choose "Web Application"
   - **Name** - Use the default one or provide your own
   - **Authorized JavaScript origins** -This isn't really used by GitLab but go
     ahead and put `https://gitlab.example.com`
   - **Authorized redirect URIs** - Enter your domain name followed by the
     callback URIs one at a time:

     ```plaintext
     https://gitlab.example.com/users/auth/google_oauth2/callback
     https://gitlab.example.com/-/google_api/auth/callback
     ```

1. You should now be able to see a Client ID and Client secret. Note them down
   or keep this page open as you need them later.
1. To enable projects to access [Google Kubernetes Engine](../user/infrastructure/clusters/index.md), you must also
   enable these APIs:
   - Google Kubernetes Engine API
   - Cloud Resource Manager API
   - Cloud Billing API

   To do so you should:

   1. Go to the [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/dashboard).
   1. Click on **ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES** button at the top of the page.
   1. Find each of the above APIs. On the page for the API, press the **ENABLE** button.
      It may take a few minutes for the API to be fully functional.

On your GitLab server:

1. Open the configuration file.

   For Omnibus GitLab:

   ```shell
   sudo editor /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb
   ```

   For installations from source:

   ```shell
   cd /home/git/gitlab
   sudo -u git -H editor config/gitlab.yml
   ```

1. See [Configure initial settings](omniauth.md#configure-initial-settings) for initial settings.
1. Add the provider configuration:

   For Omnibus GitLab:

   ```ruby
   gitlab_rails['omniauth_providers'] = [
     {
       name: "google_oauth2",
       # label: "Provider name", # optional label for login button, defaults to "Google"
       app_id: "YOUR_APP_ID",
       app_secret: "YOUR_APP_SECRET",
       args: { access_type: "offline", approval_prompt: "" }
     }
   ]
   ```

   For installations from source:

   ```yaml
   - { name: 'google_oauth2',
       # label: 'Provider name', # optional label for login button, defaults to "Google"
       app_id: 'YOUR_APP_ID',
       app_secret: 'YOUR_APP_SECRET',
       args: { access_type: 'offline', approval_prompt: '' } }
   ```

1. Change `YOUR_APP_ID` to the client ID from the Google Developer page
1. Similarly, change `YOUR_APP_SECRET` to the client secret
1. Make sure that you configure GitLab to use a fully-qualified domain name, as
   Google doesn't accept raw IP addresses.

   For Omnibus packages:

   ```ruby
   external_url 'https://gitlab.example.com'
   ```

   For installations from source:

   ```yaml
   gitlab:
     host: https://gitlab.example.com
   ```

1. Save the configuration file.
1. [Reconfigure](../administration/restart_gitlab.md#omnibus-gitlab-reconfigure)
   or [restart GitLab](../administration/restart_gitlab.md#installations-from-source) for
   the changes to take effect if you installed GitLab via Omnibus or from source
   respectively.

On the sign in page there should now be a Google icon below the regular sign in
form. Click the icon to begin the authentication process. Google asks the
user to sign in and authorize the GitLab application. If everything goes well
the user is returned to GitLab and is signed in.
