# Vulnerabilities API **(ULTIMATE)**

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/10242) in GitLab 12.6.

NOTE:
The former Vulnerabilities API was renamed to Vulnerability Findings API
and its documentation was moved to [a different location](vulnerability_findings.md).
This document now describes the new Vulnerabilities API that provides access to
[Vulnerabilities](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/634).

WARNING:
This API is in the process of being deprecated and considered unstable.
The response payload may be subject to change or breakage
across GitLab releases. Please use the
[GraphQL API](graphql/reference/index.md#queryvulnerabilities)
instead.

Every API call to vulnerabilities must be [authenticated](index.md#authentication).

Vulnerability permissions inherit permissions from their project. If a project is
private, and a user isn't a member of the project to which the vulnerability
belongs, requests to that project returns a `404 Not Found` status code.

## Single vulnerability

Gets a single vulnerability

```plaintext
GET /vulnerabilities/:id
```

| Attribute | Type | Required | Description |
| --------- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| `id` | integer or string | yes | The ID of a Vulnerability to get |

```shell
curl --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: <your_access_token>" "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/vulnerabilities/1"
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "id": 1,

## Confirm vulnerability

Confirms a given vulnerability. Returns status code `304` if the vulnerability is already confirmed.

If an authenticated user does not have permission to
[confirm vulnerabilities](../user/permissions.md#project-members-permissions),
this request results in a `403` status code.

```plaintext
POST /vulnerabilities/:id/confirm
```

| Attribute | Type | Required | Description |
| --------- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| `id` | integer or string | yes | The ID of a vulnerability to confirm |

```shell
curl --request POST --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: <your_access_token>" "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/vulnerabilities/5/confirm"
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "id": 2,
  "title": "Predictable pseudorandom number generator",
  "description": null,
  "state": "confirmed",
  "severity": "medium",
  "confidence": "medium",

  "closed_at": null
}
```

## Resolve vulnerability

Resolves a given vulnerability. Returns status code `304` if the vulnerability is already resolved.

If an authenticated user does not have permission to
[resolve vulnerabilities](../user/permissions.md#project-members-permissions),
this request results in a `403` status code.

```plaintext
