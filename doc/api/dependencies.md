# Dependencies API **(ULTIMATE)**

WARNING:
This API is in an alpha stage and considered unstable.
The response payload may be subject to change or breakage
across GitLab releases.

> - Introduced in GitLab 12.1.
> - Pagination introduced in 14.4.

Every call to this endpoint requires authentication. To perform this call, user should be authorized to read repository.
To see vulnerabilities in response, user should be authorized to read
[Project Security Dashboard](../user/application_security/security_dashboard/index.md#project-security-dashboard).

## List project dependencies

Get a list of project dependencies. This API partially mirroring
[Dependency List](../user/application_security/dependency_list/index.md) feature.
This list can be generated only for [languages and package managers](../user/application_security/dependency_scanning/index.md#supported-languages-and-package-managers)
supported by Gemnasium.

```plaintext
GET /projects/:id/dependencies
GET /projects/:id/dependencies?package_manager=maven
GET /projects/:id/dependencies?package_manager=yarn,bundler

## Dependencies pagination

By default, `GET` requests return 20 results at a time because the API results
are paginated.
