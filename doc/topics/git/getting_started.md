# Getting started **(FREE)**

## Instantiating Repositories

- Create a new repository by instantiating it through:

  ```shell
  git init
  ```

- Copy an existing project by cloning the repository through:

  ```shell
  git clone <url>
  ```

NOTE:
You can also clone GitLab projects with the
[GitLab Workflow VS Code extension](../../user/project/repository/vscode.md).
To learn more, read about the extension's
[`Git: Clone` command](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitLab.gitlab-workflow#clone-gitlab-projects).

## Central Repositories

- To instantiate a central repository a `--bare` flag is required.
- Bare repositories don't allow file editing or committing changes.
- Create a bare repository with:

  ```shell
  git init --bare project-name.git
  ```

## Instantiate workflow with clone

1. Create a project in your user namespace.
   - Choose to import from **Any Repository by URL** and use <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/training-examples.git>.
1. Create a '`Workspace`' directory in your home directory.
1. Clone the '`training-examples`' project.

```shell
mkdir ~/workspace
cd ~/workspace

git clone git@gitlab.example.com:<username>/training-examples.git
cd training-examples
```

## Git concepts

**Untracked files**

New files that Git has not been told to track previously.

**Working area**

Files that have been modified but are not committed.

**Staging area**

Modified files that have been marked to go in the next commit.

## Committing Workflow

1. Edit '`edit_this_file.rb`' in '`training-examples`'
1. See it listed as a changed file (working area)
1. View the differences
1. Stage the file
1. Commit
1. Push the commit to the remote
1. View the Git log

```shell
# Edit `edit_this_file.rb`
git status
git diff
git add <file>
git commit -m 'My change'
git push origin master
git log
```

## Note

- `git fetch` vs `git pull`
- Pull is `git fetch` + `git merge`
