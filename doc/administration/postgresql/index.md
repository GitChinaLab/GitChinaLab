# Configuring PostgreSQL for scaling **(FREE SELF)**

In this section, you'll be guided through configuring a PostgreSQL database to
be used with GitLab in one of our [reference architectures](../reference_architectures/index.md).
There are essentially three setups to choose from.

## Standalone PostgreSQL using Omnibus GitLab

This setup is for when you have installed the
[Omnibus GitLab packages](https://about.gitlab.com/install/) (CE or EE),
to use the bundled PostgreSQL having only its service enabled.

## Provide your own PostgreSQL instance

This setup is for when you have installed GitLab using the
[Omnibus GitLab packages](https://about.gitlab.com/install/) (CE or EE),
or installed it [from source](../../install/installation.md), but you want to use
your own external PostgreSQL server.

## PostgreSQL replication and failover with Omnibus GitLab **(PREMIUM SELF)**

This setup is for when you have installed GitLab using the
[Omnibus GitLab **Enterprise Edition** (EE) package](https://about.gitlab.com/install/?version=ee).

All the tools that are needed like PostgreSQL, PgBouncer, and Patroni are bundled in
the package, so you can use it to set up the whole PostgreSQL infrastructure (primary, replica).
