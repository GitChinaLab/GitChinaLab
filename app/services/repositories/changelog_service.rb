    # The `project` specifies the `Project` to generate the changelog section
    # for.
    #
    # The `user` argument specifies a `User` to use for committing the changes
    # to the Git repository.
    #
    # The `version` arguments must be a version `String` using semantic
    # versioning as the format.
    #
    # The arguments `from` and `to` must specify a Git ref or SHA to use for
    # fetching the commits to include in the changelog. The SHA/ref set in the
    # `from` argument isn't included in the list.
    #
    # The `date` argument specifies the date of the release, and defaults to the
    # current time/date.
    #
    # The `branch` argument specifies the branch to commit the changes to. The
    # branch must already exist.
    #
    # The `trailer` argument is the Git trailer to use for determining what
    # commits to include in the changelog.
    #
    # The `file` arguments specifies the name/path of the file to commit the
    # changes to. If the file doesn't exist, it's created automatically.
    #
    # The `message` argument specifies the commit message to use when committing
    # the changelog changes.
