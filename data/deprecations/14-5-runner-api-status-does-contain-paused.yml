    The GitLab Runner REST and GraphQL API endpoints will not return `paused` or `active` as a status in GitLab 15.0.

    A runner's status will only relate to runner contact status, such as:
    `online`, `offline`, or `not_connected`. Status `paused` or `active` will no longer appear.

    When checking if a runner is `paused`, API users are advised to check the boolean attribute
    `active` to be `false` instead. When checking if a runner is `active`, check if `active` is `true`.
