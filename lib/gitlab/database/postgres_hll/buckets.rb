      # that models data distribution in analysed set. This representation than can be used
      # for following purposes
      #   1. Estimating number of unique elements that this structure represents
      #   2. Merging with other Buckets structure to later estimate number of unique elements in sum of two
      #      represented data sets
      #   3. Serializing Buckets structure to json format, that can be stored in various persistence layers

      #  Like all probabilistic algorithm is has ERROR RATE margin, that can affect values,
      #  for given implementation no higher value was reported (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/45673#accuracy-estimation) than 5.3%
      #  for the most of a cases this value is lower. However, if the exact value is necessary other tools has to be used.
