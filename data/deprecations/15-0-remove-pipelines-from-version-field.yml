    In GraphQL, there are two `pipelines` fields that you can use in a [`PackageDetailsType`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/graphql/reference/#packagedetailstype) to get the pipelines for package versions:

    - The `versions` field's `pipelines` field. This returns all the pipelines associated with all the package's versions, which can pull an unbounded number of objects in memory and create performance concerns.
    - The `pipelines` field of a specific `version`. This returns only the pipelines associated with that single package version.

    To mitigate possible performance problems, we will remove the `versions` field's `pipelines` field in milestone 15.0. Although you will no longer be able to get all pipelines for all versions of a package, you can still get the pipelines of a single version through the remaining `pipelines` field for that version.
