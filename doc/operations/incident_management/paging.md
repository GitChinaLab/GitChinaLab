# Paging and notifications **(FREE)**

When there is a new alert or incident, it is important for a responder to be notified
immediately so they can triage and respond to the problem. Responders can receive
notifications using the methods described on this page.

## Slack notifications

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/216326) in GitLab 13.1.

Responders can be paged via Slack using the
[Slack Notifications Service](../../user/project/integrations/slack.md), which you
can configure for new alerts and new incidents. After configuring, responders
receive a **single** page via Slack. To set up Slack notifications on your mobile
device, make sure to enable notifications for the Slack app on your phone so
you never miss a page.

## Email notifications

Email notifications are available in projects for triggered alerts. Project
members with the **Owner** or **Maintainer** roles have the option to receive
a single email notification for new alerts.

1. On the top bar, select **Menu > Projects** and find your project.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Settings > Monitor**.
1. Expand **Alerts**.
1. On the **Alert settings** tab, select the
   **Send a single email notification to Owners and Maintainers for new alerts** checkbox.
1. Select **Save changes**.

## Paging **(PREMIUM)**

In projects that have an [on-call schedule](oncall_schedules.md) configured, on-call responders are
paged through email for triggered alerts. The on-call responder(s) receive one email for triggered
alerts.
