# Storybook

The Storybook for the `gitlab-org/gitlab` project is available on our [GitLab Pages site](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab/storybook).

## Storybook in local development

Storybook dependencies and configuration are located under the `storybook/` directory.

To build and launch Storybook locally, in the root directory of the `gitlab` project:

1. Install Storybook dependencies:

    ```shell
    yarn storybook:install
    ```

1. Build the Storybook site:

    ```shell
    yarn storybook:start
    ```

## Adding components to Storybook

Stories can be added for any Vue component in the `gitlab` repository.

To add a story:

1. Create a new `.stories.js` file in the same directory as the Vue component.
   The filename should have the same prefix as the Vue component.

    ```txt
    vue_shared/
    ├─ components/
    │  ├─ sidebar
    │  |  ├─ todo_toggle
    │  |  |  ├─ todo_button.vue
    │  │  |  ├─ todo_button.stories.js
    ```

1. Write the story as per the [official Storybook instructions](https://storybook.js.org/docs/vue/writing-stories/introduction/)

   Notes:
   - Specify the `title` field of the story as the component's file path from the `javascripts/` directory.

     For example, if the component is located at `app/assets/javascripts/vue_shared/components/sidebar/todo_toggle/todo_button.vue`, specify the story `title` as `vue_shared/components/sidebar/todo_toggle/todo_button`. This will ensure the Storybook navigation maps closely to our internal directory structure.

## Mock backend APIs

GitLab’s Storybook uses [MirajeJS](https://miragejs.com/) to mock REST and GraphQL APIs. Storybook shares the MirajeJS server
with the [frontend integration tests](../testing_guide/testing_levels.md#frontend-integration-tests). You can find the MirajeJS
configuration files in `spec/frontend_integration/mock_server`.
