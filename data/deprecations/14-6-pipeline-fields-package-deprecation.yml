    As part of the work to create a [Package Registry GraphQL API](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6318), the Package group deprecated the `pipelines` fields in all Package-related GraphQL types. As of GitLab 14.6, the `pipelines` field is deprecated in [`Package`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/graphql/reference/index.html#package) and [`PackageDetailsType`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/graphql/reference/index.html#packagedetailstype) due to scalability and performance concerns.

    In milestone 15.0, we will completely remove `pipelines` from `Package` and `PackageDetailsType`. You can follow and contribute to work on a replacement in the epic [GitLab-#7214](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7214).
