# Feature highlight

Feature highlights are represented by a pulsing blue dot. Hovering over the dot
displays more information. They're used to emphasize certain features and
highlight helpful information to the user.

You can dismiss any feature highlight permanently by clicking the **Got it** link
at the bottom of the information window. You cannot restore a feature highlight
after you dismiss it.
