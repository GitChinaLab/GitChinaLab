# This file exists to lock the attributes of Design Management models
# that get copied in `DesignManagement::CopyDesignCollection::CopyService`
# to specific schemas.
#
# This allows us to perform sanity checks and alert when there are changes
# to the schema by running expectations against the lists in this file
# and the actual schema of the models in `copy_designs_service_spec.rb`.
#
# If you are here because you received a failed test in
# `copy_designs_service_spec.rb`, you need to decide how to handle the
# changes and whether the new attribute(s) should be included in the copy
# or ignored.

# COPY.
# Add attributes that should be copied to the `{model}_attributes` lists:
design_attributes:
  - filename
  - relative_position

version_attributes:
  - author_id
  - created_at

action_attributes: # (None)

# IGNORE.
# Add attributes that should not be copied to the `ignore_{model}_attributes` lists:
ignore_design_attributes:
  - id
  - issue_id
  - project_id
  - iid

ignore_version_attributes:
  - id
  - issue_id
  - sha

ignore_action_attributes:
  - id
  - design_id
  - event
  - image_v432x230
  - version_id
