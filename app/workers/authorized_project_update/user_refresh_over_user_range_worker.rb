    # This worker checks if users requires an update to their project_authorizations records.
    # This check is done via the data read from the database replica (and not from the primary).
    # If this check returns true, a completely new Sidekiq job is enqueued for a specific user
    # so as to update its project_authorizations records.

    # There is a possibility that the data in the replica is lagging behind the primary
    # and hence it becomes very important that we check if an update is indeed required for this user
    # once again via the primary database, which is the reason why we enqueue a completely new Sidekiq job
    # via `UserRefreshWithLowUrgencyWorker` for this user.
