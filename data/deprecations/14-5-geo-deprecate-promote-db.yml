# This is a template for a feature deprecation
# A deprecation typically occurs when a feature or capability is planned to be removed in a future release.
# Deprecations should be announced at least two releases prior to removal.  Any breaking changes should only be done in major releases.
#
# Below is an example of what a single entry should look like, it's required attributes,
# and what types we expect those attribute values to be.
#
# For more information please refer to the handbook documentation here:

    In GitLab 14.5, we introduced the command `gitlab-ctl promote` to promote any Geo secondary node to a primary during a failover. This command replaces `gitlab-ctl promote-db` which is used to promote database nodes in multi-node Geo secondary sites. `gitlab-ctl promote-db` will continue to function as-is and be available until GitLab 15.0. We recommend that Geo customers begin testing the new `gitlab-ctl promote` command in their staging environments and incorporating the new command in their failover procedures.
