    ### Addition to `#{common}`

    You have added a new rule to `#{common}`. Are you sure you need this rule?

    If it is a component class shared across items, could it be added to the component as a utility class or to the component's stylesheet? If not, you can ignore this warning.

    If it is a new utility class, is there another class that shares the same values in either this file or in `#{utilities}`? If not, please add it to `#{utilities}`, following the [Gitlab UI naming style](https://unpkg.com/browse/@gitlab/ui/src/scss/utilities.scss).

    ### Addition to `#{utilities}`

    You have added a new rule to `#{utilities}`. Are you sure you need this rule?

    If it is a component class shared across items, could it be added to the component as a utility class or to the component's stylesheet? If not, consider adding it to `#{common}`

    If it is a new utility class, is there another class that shares the same values in either this file or in `#{utilities}`? If not, please be sure this addition follows the [Gitlab UI naming style](https://unpkg.com/browse/@gitlab/ui/src/scss/utilities.scss) so it may be removed when these rules are included.
