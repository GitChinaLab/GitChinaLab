# Compliance **(ULTIMATE)**

The compliance tools provided by GitLab let you keep an eye on various aspects of your project. The
following compliance tools are available:

- [Compliance report](compliance_report/index.md): View recent merge request activity across
  all projects in a group. This lets you see if merge requests were approved, and by whom.
- [License Compliance](license_compliance/index.md): Search your project's dependencies for their
  licenses. This lets you determine if the licenses of your project's dependencies are compatible
  with your project's license.
- [Compliance framework labels](../project/settings/index.md#compliance-frameworks): Label your projects that have unique compliance requirements.
- [Compliance pipelines](../project/settings/index.md#compliance-pipeline-configuration): Ensure that needed compliance jobs are always run for compliance-labeled projects.
- [Audit Events](../../administration/audit_events.md): Get visibility into individual actions that have taken place in your GitLab instance, group, or project.
- [Audit Reports](../../administration/audit_reports.md): Create and access reports based on the audit events that have occurred. Use pre-built GitLab reports or the API to build your own.
