# Add a cluster using cluster certificates (DEPRECATED) **(FREE)**

> [Deprecated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/327908) in GitLab 14.0.

WARNING:
This feature was [deprecated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/327908) in GitLab 14.0.
To create a new cluster use [Infrastructure as Code](../../infrastructure/iac/index.md#create-a-new-cluster-through-iac-deprecated).

NOTE:
Every new Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account receives
[$300 in credit upon sign up](https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial).
In partnership with Google, GitLab is able to offer an additional $200 for new GCP
accounts to get started with the GitLab integration with Google Kubernetes Engine.
[Follow this link](https://cloud.google.com/partners/partnercredit/?pcn_code=0014M00001h35gDQAQ#contact-form)
to apply for credit.

NOTE:
Watch the webcast [Scalable app deployment with GitLab and Google Cloud Platform](https://about.gitlab.com/webcast/scalable-app-deploy/)
and learn how to spin up a Kubernetes cluster managed by Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
in a few clicks.

## Create new cluster

> [Deprecated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/327908) in GitLab 14.0.

As of GitLab 14.0, use [Infrastructure as Code](../../infrastructure/iac/index.md#create-a-new-cluster-through-iac-deprecated)
to **safely create new clusters from GitLab**.

Creating clusters from GitLab using cluster certificates is still available on the
GitLab UI but was **deprecated** in GitLab 14.0 and is scheduled for removal in
GitLab 15.0. We don't recommend using this method.

You can create a new cluster hosted in EKS, GKE, on premises, and with other
providers using cluster certificates:

- [New cluster hosted on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](add_gke_clusters.md).
- [New cluster hosted on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](add_eks_clusters.md).

To host them on premises and with other providers, you can use Terraform
or your preferred tool of choice to create and connect a cluster with GitLab.
The [GitLab Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/gitlabhq/gitlab/latest/docs/resources/project_cluster)
supports connecting existing clusters using the certificate-based connection method.

## Add existing cluster

As of GitLab 14.0, use the [GitLab Agent](../../clusters/agent/index.md)
to connect your cluster to GitLab.

Alternatively, you can [add an existing cluster](add_existing_cluster.md)
through the certificate-based method, but we don't recommend using this method for [security implications](../../infrastructure/clusters/connect/index.md#security-implications-for-clusters-connected-with-certificates).

## Configure your cluster

As of GitLab 14.0, use the [GitLab Agent](../../clusters/agent/index.md)
to configure your cluster.

## Disable a cluster

When you successfully create a new Kubernetes cluster or add an existing
one to GitLab, the cluster connection to GitLab becomes enabled. To disable it:

1. Go to your:
   - Project's **{cloud-gear}** **Infrastructure > Kubernetes clusters** page, for a project-level cluster.
   - Group's **{cloud-gear}** **Kubernetes** page, for a group-level cluster.
   - **Menu > Admin > Kubernetes** page, for an instance-level cluster.
1. Select the name of the cluster you want to disable.
1. Toggle **GitLab Integration** off (in gray).
1. Click **Save changes**.

## Remove a cluster

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/26815) in GitLab 12.6, you can remove cluster integrations and resources.

When you remove a cluster integration, you only remove the cluster relationship
to GitLab, not the cluster. To remove the cluster itself, visit your cluster's
GKE or EKS dashboard to do it from their UI or use `kubectl`.

You need at least Maintainer [permissions](../../permissions.md) to your
project or group to remove the integration with GitLab.

When removing a cluster integration, you have two options:

- **Remove integration**: remove only the Kubernetes integration.
- **Remove integration and resources**: remove the cluster integration and
all GitLab cluster-related resources such as namespaces, roles, and bindings.

To remove the Kubernetes cluster integration:

1. Go to your cluster details page.
1. Select the **Advanced Settings** tab.
1. Select either **Remove integration** or **Remove integration and resources**.

## Access controls

See [cluster access controls (RBAC or ABAC)](cluster_access.md).

## Troubleshooting

### There was a problem authenticating with your cluster. Please ensure your CA Certificate and Token are valid

If you encounter this error while adding a Kubernetes cluster, ensure you're
properly pasting the service token. Some shells may add a line break to the
service token, making it invalid. Ensure that there are no line breaks by
pasting your token into an editor and removing any additional spaces.

You may also experience this error if your certificate is not valid. To check that your certificate's
subject alternative names contain the correct domain for your cluster's API, run this:

```shell
echo | openssl s_client -showcerts -connect kubernetes.example.com:443 2>/dev/null |
openssl x509 -inform pem -noout -text
```

Note that the `-connect` argument expects a `host:port` combination. For example, `https://kubernetes.example.com` would be `kubernetes.example.com:443`.
