# Project statistics API **(FREE)**

Every API call to [project](../user/project/index.md) statistics must be authenticated.
Retrieving these statistics requires write access to the repository.

This API retrieves the number of times the project is either cloned or pulled
with the HTTP method. SSH fetches are not included.

## Get the statistics of the last 30 days

GET /projects/:id/statistics
```

| Attribute  | Type   | Required | Description |

| `id`      | integer or string | yes      | The ID or [URL-encoded path of the project](index.md#namespaced-path-encoding) |
