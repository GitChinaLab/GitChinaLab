# Report abuse **(FREE)**

You can report abuse from other GitLab users to GitLab administrators.

A GitLab administrator [can then choose](admin_area/review_abuse_reports.md) to:

- Remove the user, which deletes them from the instance.
- Block the user, which denies them access to the instance.
- Or remove the report, which retains the user's access to the instance.

You can report a user through their:

- [Profile](#report-abuse-from-the-users-profile-page)
- [Comments](#report-abuse-from-a-users-comment)
- [Issues](#report-abuse-from-an-issue)
