# Epic boards **(PREMIUM)**

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5067) in GitLab 13.10.
> - [Feature flag removed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/290039) in GitLab 14.1.

INFO:
Try epic boards and more with a
[free 30-day trial of GitLab Ultimate](https://about.gitlab.com/free-trial/index.html?glm_source=docs.gitlab.com&glm_content=p-epics-boards-docs).

Epic boards build on the existing [epic tracking functionality](index.md) and
[labels](../../project/labels.md). Your epics appear as cards in vertical lists, organized by their assigned
labels.

To view an epic board:

1. On the top bar, select **Menu > Groups** and find your group.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Epics > Boards**.

### Filter epics

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5079) in GitLab 14.0.

Use the filters on top of your epic board to show only
the results you want. It's similar to the filtering used in the epic list,
as the metadata from the epics and labels is re-used in the epic board.

You can filter by the following:

- Author
- Label

### View count of issues, weight, and progress of an epic

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/331330) in GitLab 14.1.

Epics on an epic board show a summary of their issues, weight, and progress.
To see the number of open and closed issues and the completed and incomplete
weight, hover over the issues icon **{issues}**, weight icon **{weight}**, or
progress icon **{progress}**.

### Move epics and lists

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5079) in GitLab 14.0.

You can move epics and lists by dragging them.

Prerequisites:

- You must have at least the [Reporter role](../../permissions.md#group-members-permissions) for a group.

To move an epic, select the epic card and drag it to another position in its current list or
into another list. Learn about possible effects in [Dragging epics between lists](#dragging-epics-between-lists).

To move a list, select its top bar, and drag it horizontally.
You can't move the **Open** and **Closed** lists, but you can hide them when editing an epic board.

#### Dragging epics between lists

When you drag epics between lists, the result is different depending on the source list
and the target list.

|                       | To Open        | To Closed  | To label B list                |
| --------------------- | -------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| **From Open**         | -              | Close epic | Add label B                    |
| **From Closed**       | Reopen epic    | -          | Reopen epic and add label B    |
| **From label A list** | Remove label A | Close epic | Remove label A and add label B |

### Edit the scope of an epic board

Prerequisites:

- You must have at least the [Reporter role](../../permissions.md#group-members-permissions) for a group.
