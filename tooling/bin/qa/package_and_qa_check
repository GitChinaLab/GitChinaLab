# This script checks if the package-and-qa job should trigger downstream pipelines to run the QA suite.
#
# It assumes the first argument is a directory of files containing diffs of changes from an MR
# (e.g., created by tooling/bin/find_change_diffs). It exits with a success code if there are no diffs, or if the diffs
# are suitable to run QA tests.
#
# The script will abort (exit code 1) if the argument is missing.

# The following condition will result in a failure code (2), indicating that package-and-qa should not run:
#
#   - If the changes only include tests being put in quarantine
