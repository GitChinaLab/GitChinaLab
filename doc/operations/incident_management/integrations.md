# Integrations **(FREE)**

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/13203) in GitLab 12.4.
> - [Moved](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/42640) from GitLab Ultimate to GitLab Free in 12.8.

GitLab can accept alerts from any source via a webhook receiver. This can be configured
generically or, in GitLab versions 13.1 and greater, you can configure
[External Prometheus instances](../metrics/alerts.md#external-prometheus-instances)
to use this endpoint.

## Integrations list

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/245331) in GitLab 13.5.

With at least the Maintainer [role](../../user/permissions.md), you can view the list of configured
alerts integrations by navigating to **Settings > Monitor**
in your project's sidebar menu, and expanding the **Alerts** section. The list displays
the integration name, type, and status (enabled or disabled):

![Current Integrations](img/integrations_list_v13_5.png)

## Configuration

GitLab can receive alerts via a HTTP endpoint that you configure,
or the [Prometheus integration](#external-prometheus-integration).

### Single HTTP Endpoint

Enabling the HTTP Endpoint in a GitLab projects activates it to
receive alert payloads in JSON format. You can always
[customize the payload](#customize-the-alert-payload-outside-of-gitlab) to your liking.

1. Sign in to GitLab as a user with the Maintainer [role](../../user/permissions.md)
   for a project.
1. Navigate to **Settings > Monitor** in your project.
1. Expand the **Alerts** section, and in the **Select integration type** dropdown menu,
   select **HTTP Endpoint**.
1. Toggle the **Active** alert setting. The URL and Authorization Key for the webhook configuration
   are available in the **View credentials** tab after you save the integration. You must also input
   the URL and Authorization Key in your external service.

### HTTP Endpoints **(PREMIUM)**

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4442) in GitLab 13.6.

In [GitLab Premium](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/), you can create multiple
unique HTTP endpoints to receive alerts from any external source in JSON format,
and you can [customize the payload](#customize-the-alert-payload-outside-of-gitlab).

1. Sign in to GitLab as a user with the Maintainer [role](../../user/permissions.md)
   for a project.
1. Navigate to **Settings > Monitor** in your project.
1. Expand the **Alerts** section.
1. For each endpoint you want to create:

   1. Click the **Add new integration** button.
   1. In the **Select integration type** dropdown menu, select **HTTP Endpoint**.
   1. Name the integration.
   1. Toggle the **Active** alert setting. The **URL** and **Authorization Key** for the webhook
      configuration are available in the **View credentials** tab after you save the integration.
      You must also input the URL and Authorization Key in your external service.
   1. Optional. To map fields from your monitoring tool's alert to GitLab fields, enter a sample
      payload and click **Parse payload for custom mapping**. Valid JSON is required. If you update
      a sample payload, you must also remap the fields.

   1. Optional. If you provided a valid sample payload, select each value in
      **Payload alert key** to [map to a **GitLab alert key**](#map-fields-in-custom-alerts).
   1. To save your integration, click **Save Integration**. If desired, you can send a test alert
      from your integration's **Send test alert** tab after the integration is created.

The new HTTP Endpoint displays in the [integrations list](#integrations-list).
You can edit the integration by selecting the **{settings}** settings icon on the right
side of the integrations list.

#### Map fields in custom alerts

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4443) in GitLab 13.10.

You can integrate your monitoring tool's alert format with GitLab alerts. To show the
correct information in the [Alert list](alerts.md) and the
[Alert Details page](alerts.md#alert-details-page), map your alert's fields to
GitLab fields when you [create an HTTP endpoint](#http-endpoints):

![Alert Management List](img/custom_alert_mapping_v13_11.png)

### External Prometheus integration

For GitLab versions 13.1 and greater, read
[External Prometheus Instances](../metrics/alerts.md#external-prometheus-instances)
to configure alerts for this integration.

## Customize the alert payload outside of GitLab

For HTTP Endpoints without [custom mappings](#map-fields-in-custom-alerts), you can customize the payload by sending the following
parameters. All fields are optional. If the incoming alert does not contain a value for the `Title` field, a default value of `New: Alert` will be applied.

| Property                  | Type            | Description |
| ------------------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| `title`                   | String          | The title of the alert.|
| `description`             | String          | A high-level summary of the problem. |
| `start_time`              | DateTime        | The time of the alert. If none is provided, a current time is used. |
| `end_time`                | DateTime        | The resolution time of the alert. If provided, the alert is resolved. |
| `service`                 | String          | The affected service. |
| `monitoring_tool`         | String          | The name of the associated monitoring tool. |
| `hosts`                   | String or Array | One or more hosts, as to where this incident occurred. |
| `severity`                | String          | The severity of the alert. Case-insensitive. Can be one of: `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`, `info`, `unknown`. Defaults to `critical` if missing or value is not in this list. |
| `fingerprint`             | String or Array | The unique identifier of the alert. This can be used to group occurrences of the same alert. |
| `gitlab_environment_name` | String          | The name of the associated GitLab [environment](../../ci/environments/index.md). Required to [display alerts on a dashboard](../../user/operations_dashboard/index.md#adding-a-project-to-the-dashboard). |

You can also add custom fields to the alert's payload. The values of extra
parameters aren't limited to primitive types (such as strings or numbers), but
can be a nested JSON object. For example:

```json
{ "foo": { "bar": { "baz": 42 } } }
```

NOTE:
Ensure your requests are smaller than the
[payload application limits](../../administration/instance_limits.md#generic-alert-json-payloads).

### Example request body

Example payload:

```json
{
  "title": "Incident title",
  "description": "Short description of the incident",
  "start_time": "2019-09-12T06:00:55Z",
  "service": "service affected",
  "monitoring_tool": "value",
  "hosts": "value",
  "severity": "high",
  "fingerprint": "d19381d4e8ebca87b55cda6e8eee7385",
  "foo": {
    "bar": {
      "baz": 42
    }
  }
}
```

## Authorization

The following authorization methods are accepted:

- Bearer authorization header
- Basic authentication

The `<authorization_key>` and `<url>` values can be found when configuring an alert integration.

### Bearer authorization header

The authorization key can be used as the Bearer token:

```shell
curl --request POST \
  --data '{"title": "Incident title"}' \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer <authorization_key>" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  <url>
```

### Basic authentication

The authorization key can be used as the `password`. The `username` is left blank:

- username: `<blank>`
- password: authorization_key

```shell
curl --request POST \
  --data '{"title": "Incident title"}' \
  --header "Authorization: Basic <base_64_encoded_credentials>" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  <url>
```

Basic authentication can also be used with credentials directly in the URL:

```shell
curl --request POST \
  --data '{"title": "Incident title"}' \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  <username:password@url>
```

WARNING:
Using your authorization key in the URL is insecure, as it's visible in server logs. We recommend
using one of the above header options if your tooling supports it.

## Response body

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/342730) in GitLab 14.5.

The JSON response body contains a list of any alerts created within the request:

```json
[
  {
    "iid": 1,
    "title": "Incident title"
  },
  {
    "iid": 2,
    "title": "Second Incident title"
  }
]
```

Successful responses return a `200` response code.

## Triggering test alerts

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3066) in GitLab in 13.2.

After a [project maintainer or owner](../../user/permissions.md)
configures an integration, you can trigger a test
alert to confirm your integration works properly.

1. Sign in as a user with at least the Developer [role](../../user/permissions.md).
1. Navigate to **Settings > Monitor** in your project.
1. Click **Alerts** to expand the section.
1. Click the **{settings}** settings icon on the right side of the integration in [the list](#integrations-list).
1. Select the **Send test alert** tab to open it.
1. Enter a test payload in the payload field (valid JSON is required).
1. Click **Send**.

GitLab displays an error or success message, depending on the outcome of your test.

## Automatic grouping of identical alerts **(PREMIUM)**

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/214557) in GitLab 13.2.

In GitLab versions 13.2 and greater, GitLab groups alerts based on their
payload. When an incoming alert contains the same payload as another alert
(excluding the `start_time` and `hosts` attributes), GitLab groups these alerts
together and displays a counter on the [Alert Management List](incidents.md)
and details pages.

If the existing alert is already `resolved`, GitLab creates a new alert instead.

![Alert Management List](img/alert_list_v13_1.png)

## Recovery alerts

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/13402) in GitLab 13.4.

The alert in GitLab will be automatically resolved when an HTTP Endpoint
receives a payload with the end time of the alert set. For HTTP Endpoints
without [custom mappings](#map-fields-in-custom-alerts), the expected
field is `end_time`. With custom mappings, you can select the expected field.

You can also configure the associated [incident to be closed automatically](../incident_management/incidents.md#automatically-close-incidents-via-recovery-alerts) when the alert resolves.

## Link to your Opsgenie Alerts **(PREMIUM)**

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3066) in GitLab 13.2.

WARNING:
We are building deeper integration with Opsgenie and other alerting tools through
[HTTP endpoint integrations](#single-http-endpoint) so you can see alerts in
the GitLab interface. As a result, the previous direct link to Opsgenie Alerts from
the GitLab alerts list is deprecated in
GitLab versions [13.8 and later](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/273657).

You can monitor alerts using a GitLab integration with [Opsgenie](https://www.atlassian.com/software/opsgenie).

If you enable the Opsgenie integration, you can't have other GitLab alert
services
active at the same time.

To enable Opsgenie integration:

1. Sign in as a user with the Maintainer or Owner [role](../../user/permissions.md).
1. Navigate to **Monitor > Alerts**.
1. In the **Integrations** select box, select **Opsgenie**.
1. Select the **Active** toggle.
1. In the **API URL** field, enter the base URL for your Opsgenie integration,
   such as `https://app.opsgenie.com/alert/list`.
1. Select **Save changes**.

After you enable the integration, navigate to the Alerts list page at
**Monitor > Alerts**, and then select **View alerts in Opsgenie**.
