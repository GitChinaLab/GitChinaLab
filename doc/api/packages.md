# Packages API **(FREE)**

This is the API documentation of [GitLab Packages](../administration/packages/index.md).

## List packages

### Within a project

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/9259) in GitLab 11.8.

Get a list of project packages. All package types are included in results. When
accessed without authentication, only packages of public projects are returned.

```plaintext
GET /projects/:id/packages
```

| Attribute | Type | Required | Description |
| --------- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| `id`      | integer/string | yes | ID or [URL-encoded path of the project](index.md#namespaced-path-encoding) |
| `order_by`| string | no | The field to use as order. One of `created_at` (default), `name`, `version`, or `type`. |
| `sort`    | string | no | The direction of the order, either `asc` (default) for ascending order or `desc` for descending order. |
| `package_type` | string | no | Filter the returned packages by type. One of `conan`, `maven`, `npm`, `pypi`, `composer`, `nuget`, `helm`, or `golang`. (_Introduced in GitLab 12.9_)
| `package_name` | string | no | Filter the project packages with a fuzzy search by name. (_Introduced in GitLab 12.9_)
| `include_versionless` | boolean | no | When set to true, versionless packages are included in the response. (_Introduced in GitLab 13.8_)
| `status` | string | no | Filter the returned packages by status. One of `default` (default), `hidden`, or `processing`. (_Introduced in GitLab 13.9_)

```shell
curl --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: <your_access_token>" "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/:id/packages"
```

Example response:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "com/mycompany/my-app",
    "version": "1.0-SNAPSHOT",
    "package_type": "maven",
    "created_at": "2019-11-27T03:37:38.711Z"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "@foo/bar",
    "version": "1.0.3",
    "package_type": "npm",
    "created_at": "2019-11-27T03:37:38.711Z"
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "name": "Hello/0.1@mycompany/stable",
    "conan_package_name": "Hello",
    "version": "0.1",
    "package_type": "conan",
    "_links": {
      "web_path": "/foo/bar/-/packages/3",
      "delete_api_path": "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/1/packages/3"
    },
    "created_at": "2029-12-16T20:33:34.316Z",
    "tags": []
  }
]
```

By default, the `GET` request returns 20 results, because the API is [paginated](index.md#pagination).

Although you can filter packages by status, working with packages that have a `processing` status
can result in malformed data or broken packages.

### Within a group

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/18871) in GitLab 12.5.

Get a list of project packages at the group level.
When accessed without authentication, only packages of public projects are returned.

```plaintext
GET /groups/:id/packages
```

| Attribute | Type | Required | Description |
| --------- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| `id`      | integer/string | yes | ID or [URL-encoded path of the group](index.md#namespaced-path-encoding). |
| `exclude_subgroups` | boolean | false | If the parameter is included as true, packages from projects from subgroups are not listed. Default is `false`. |
| `order_by`| string | no | The field to use as order. One of `created_at` (default), `name`, `version`, `type`, or `project_path`. |
| `sort`    | string | no | The direction of the order, either `asc` (default) for ascending order or `desc` for descending order. |
| `package_type` | string | no | Filter the returned packages by type. One of `conan`, `maven`, `npm`, `pypi`, `composer`, `nuget`, `helm`, or `golang`. (_Introduced in GitLab 12.9_) |
| `package_name` | string | no | Filter the project packages with a fuzzy search by name. (_[Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/30980) in GitLab 13.0_)
| `include_versionless` | boolean | no | When set to true, versionless packages are included in the response. (_Introduced in GitLab 13.8_)
| `status` | string | no | Filter the returned packages by status. One of `default` (default), `hidden`, or `processing`. (_Introduced in GitLab 13.9_)

```shell
curl --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: <your_access_token>" "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/groups/:id/packages?exclude_subgroups=false"
```

By default, the `GET` request returns 20 results, because the API is [paginated](index.md#pagination).

The `_links` object contains the following properties:

- `web_path`: The path which you can visit in GitLab and see the details of the package.
- `delete_api_path`: The API path to delete the package. Only available if the request user has permission to do so.

Although you can filter packages by status, working with packages that have a `processing` status
can result in malformed data or broken packages.
