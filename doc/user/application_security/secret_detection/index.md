# Secret Detection **(FREE)**

> - [Introduced](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/03/22/gitlab-11-9-released/#detect-secrets-and-credentials-in-the-repository) in GitLab 11.9.
> - [Moved](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/222788) from GitLab Ultimate to GitLab Free in 13.3.

A recurring problem when developing applications is that developers may unintentionally commit
secrets and credentials to their remote repositories. If other people have access to the source,
or if the project is public, the sensitive information is then exposed and can be leveraged by
malicious users to gain access to resources like deployment environments.

GitLab 11.9 includes a new check called Secret Detection. It scans the content of the repository
to find API keys and other information that should not be there.

GitLab displays identified secrets visibly in a few places:

- [Security Dashboard](../security_dashboard/)
- Pipelines' **Security** tab
- Report in the merge request widget

![Secret Detection in merge request widget](img/secret_detection_v13_2.png)

## Use cases

- Detecting unintentional commit of secrets like keys, passwords, and API tokens.
- Performing a single or recurring scan of the full history of your repository for secrets.

## Supported secrets

Secret Detection detects a variety of common secrets by default. You can also customize the secret detection patterns using [custom rulesets](#custom-rulesets).
The [default ruleset](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/secrets/-/blob/master/gitleaks.toml) includes **90+ secret detection patterns**.
You can contribute "well-identifiable" secrets by follow the steps detailed in the [community contributions guidelines](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/345453).

WARNING:
Gitleaks does not support scanning binary files.

## Requirements

To run Secret Detection jobs, by default, you need GitLab Runner with the
[`docker`](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/docker.html) or
[`kubernetes`](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/kubernetes.html) executor.
If you're using the shared runners on GitLab.com, this is enabled by default.

WARNING:
Our Secret Detection jobs expect a Linux container type. Windows containers are not supported.

WARNING:
If you use your own runners, make sure the Docker version installed
is **not** `19.03.0`. See [troubleshooting information](../sast#error-response-from-daemon-error-processing-tar-file-docker-tar-relocation-error) for details.

### Making Secret Detection available to all GitLab tiers

To make Secret Detection available to as many customers as possible, we have enabled it for all GitLab tiers.
However not all features are available on every tier. See the breakdown below for more details.

#### Summary of features per tier

Different features are available in different [GitLab tiers](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/),
as shown in the following table:

| Capability                                                      | In Free & Premium   | In Ultimate        |

## Configuration

> - In GitLab 13.1, Secret Detection was split from the [SAST configuration](../sast#configuration) into its own CI/CD template. If you're using GitLab 13.0 or earlier and SAST is enabled, then Secret Detection is already enabled.
> - [In GitLab 14.0](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/297269), Secret Detection jobs `secret_detection_default_branch` and `secret_detection` were consolidated into one job, `secret_detection`.

Secret Detection is performed by a [specific analyzer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/Secret-Detection.gitlab-ci.yml)
during the `secret-detection` job. It runs regardless of your app's programming language.

The Secret Detection analyzer includes [Gitleaks](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks) checks.

Note that the Secret Detection analyzer ignores Password-in-URL vulnerabilities if the password
begins with a dollar sign (`$`), as this likely indicates the password is an environment variable.
For example, `https://username:$password@example.com/path/to/repo` isn't detected, while
`https://username:password@example.com/path/to/repo` is.

NOTE:
You don't have to configure Secret Detection manually as shown in this section if you're using
[Auto Secret Detection](../../../topics/autodevops/stages.md#auto-secret-detection),
provided by [Auto DevOps](../../../topics/autodevops/index.md).

To enable Secret Detection for GitLab 13.1 and later, you must include the
`Secret-Detection.gitlab-ci.yml` template that's provided as a part of your GitLab installation. For
GitLab versions earlier than 11.9, you can copy and use the job as defined in that template.

Ensure your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file has a `stage` called `test`, and add the following to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

```yaml
include:
  - template: Security/Secret-Detection.gitlab-ci.yml
```

The included template creates Secret Detection jobs in your CI/CD pipeline and scans
your project's source code for secrets.

The results are saved as a
[Secret Detection report artifact](../../../ci/yaml/artifacts_reports.md#artifactsreportssecret_detection)
that you can later download and analyze. Due to implementation limitations, we
always take the latest Secret Detection artifact available.

### Enable Secret Detection via an automatic merge request

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4496) in GitLab 13.11, deployed behind a feature flag, enabled by default.
> - [Feature flag removed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/329886) in GitLab 14.1.

To enable Secret Detection in a project, you can create a merge request
from the Security Configuration page.

1. In the project where you want to enable Secret Detection, go to
   **Security & Compliance > Configuration**.
1. In the **Secret Detection** row, select **Configure with a merge request**.

This automatically creates a merge request with the changes necessary to enable Secret Detection
that you can review and merge to complete the configuration.

NOTE:
The configuration tool works best with no existing `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, or with a minimal
configuration file. If you have a complex GitLab configuration file it may not be parsed
successfully, and an error may occur.

### Customizing settings

The Secret Detection scan settings can be changed through [CI/CD variables](#available-cicd-variables)
by using the
[`variables`](../../../ci/yaml/index.md#variables) parameter in `.gitlab-ci.yml`.

To override a job definition, (for example, change properties like `variables` or `dependencies`),
declare a job with the same name as the secret detection job to override. Place this new job after the template
inclusion and specify any additional keys under it.

WARNING:
Beginning in GitLab 13.0, the use of [`only` and `except`](../../../ci/yaml/index.md#only--except)
is no longer supported. When overriding the template, you must use [`rules`](../../../ci/yaml/index.md#rules) instead.

#### `GIT_DEPTH` variable

The [`GIT_DEPTH` CI/CD variable](../../../ci/runners/configure_runners.md#shallow-cloning) affects Secret Detection.
The Secret Detection analyzer relies on generating patches between commits to scan content for
secrets. If you override the default, ensure the value is greater than 1. If the number of commits
in an MR is greater than the `GIT_DEPTH` value, Secret Detection will [fail to detect secrets](#error-couldnt-run-the-gitleaks-command-exit-status-2).

#### Custom settings example

In the following example, we include the Secret Detection template and at the same time we
override the `secret_detection` job with the `SECRET_DETECTION_HISTORIC_SCAN` CI/CD variable to `true`:

```yaml
include:
  - template: Security/Secret-Detection.gitlab-ci.yml

secret_detection:
  variables:
    SECRET_DETECTION_HISTORIC_SCAN: "true"
```

Because the template is [evaluated before](../../../ci/yaml/index.md#include)
the pipeline configuration, the last mention of the variable takes precedence.

#### Available CI/CD variables

Secret Detection can be customized by defining available CI/CD variables:

| CI/CD variable                    | Default value | Description |
|-----------------------------------|---------------|-------------|
| `SECRET_DETECTION_COMMIT_FROM`    | -             | The commit a Gitleaks scan starts at. [Removed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/243564) in GitLab 13.5. Replaced with `SECRET_DETECTION_COMMITS`. |
| `SECRET_DETECTION_COMMIT_TO`      | -             | The commit a Gitleaks scan ends at. [Removed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/243564) in GitLab 13.5. Replaced with `SECRET_DETECTION_COMMITS`. |
| `SECRET_DETECTION_COMMITS`        | -             | The list of commits that Gitleaks should scan. [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/243564) in GitLab 13.5. |
| `SECRET_DETECTION_EXCLUDED_PATHS` | ""            | Exclude vulnerabilities from output based on the paths. This is a comma-separated list of patterns. Patterns can be globs, or file or folder paths (for example, `doc,spec` ). Parent directories also match patterns. [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/225273) in GitLab 13.3. |
| `SECRET_DETECTION_HISTORIC_SCAN`  | false         | Flag to enable a historic Gitleaks scan. |

### Custom rulesets **(ULTIMATE)**

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/211387) in GitLab 13.5.
> - [Added](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/339614) support for
>   passthrough chains. Expanded to include additional passthrough types of `file`, `git`, and `url` in GitLab 14.6.

You can customize the default secret detection rules provided with GitLab.
Customization allows replacing the default secret detection rules with rules that you define.

To create a custom ruleset:

1. Create a `.gitlab` directory at the root of your project, if one doesn't already exist.
1. Create a custom ruleset file named `secret-detection-ruleset.toml` in the `.gitlab` directory.
1. In the `secret-detection-ruleset.toml` file, do one of the following:

   - Define a custom ruleset:

     ```toml
     [secrets]
       description = 'secrets custom rules configuration'

       [[secrets.passthrough]]
         type  = "raw"
         target = "gitleaks.toml"
         value = """\
     title = "gitleaks config"
     # add regexes to the regex table
     [[rules]]
     description = "Test for Raw Custom Rulesets"
     regex = '''Custom Raw Ruleset T[est]{3}'''
     """
     ```

   - Provide the name of the file containing a custom ruleset:

     ```toml
     [secrets]
       description = 'secrets custom rules configuration'

       [[secrets.passthrough]]
         type  = "file"
         target = "gitleaks.toml"
         value = "config/gitleaks.toml"
     ```

Passthroughs can also be chained to build more complex configurations.
For more details, see [SAST Customize ruleset section](../sast/index.md#customize-rulesets).

### Logging level

To control the verbosity of logs set the `SECURE_LOG_LEVEL` CI/CD variable. Messages of this logging level or higher are output. [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/10880) in GitLab 13.1.

From highest to lowest severity, the logging levels are:

- `fatal`
- `error`
- `warn`
- `info` (default)
- `debug`

## Post-processing and revocation

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4639) in GitLab 13.6.

Upon detection of a secret, GitLab supports post-processing hooks. These can be used to take actions like notifying the cloud service who issued the secret. The cloud provider can confirm the credentials and take remediation actions like revoking or reissuing a new secret and notifying the creator of the secret. Post-processing workflows vary by supported cloud providers.

GitLab currently supports post-processing for following service providers:

- Amazon Web Services (AWS)

Third party cloud and SaaS providers can [express integration interest by filling out this form](https://forms.gle/wWpvrtLRK21Q2WJL9). Learn more about the [technical details of post-processing secrets](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4639).

NOTE:
Post-processing is currently limited to a project's default branch, see the above epic for future efforts to support additional branches.

## Full History Secret Detection

GitLab 12.11 introduced support for scanning the full history of a repository. This new functionality
is particularly useful when you are enabling Secret Detection in a repository for the first time and you
want to perform a full secret detection scan. Running a secret detection scan on the full history can take a long time,
especially for larger repositories with lengthy Git histories. We recommend not setting this CI/CD variable
as part of your normal job definition.

A new configuration variable ([`SECRET_DETECTION_HISTORIC_SCAN`](#available-cicd-variables))
can be set to change the behavior of the GitLab Secret Detection scan to run on the entire Git history of a repository.

We have created a [short video walkthrough](https://youtu.be/wDtc_K00Y0A) showcasing how you can perform a full history secret detection scan.

## Running Secret Detection in an offline environment

For self-managed GitLab instances in an environment with limited, restricted, or intermittent access
to external resources through the internet, some adjustments are required for the Secret Detection job to
run successfully. For more information, see [Offline environments](../offline_deployments/index.md).

### Requirements for offline Secret Detection

To use Secret Detection in an offline environment, you need:

- GitLab Runner with the [`docker` or `kubernetes` executor](#requirements).
- A Docker Container Registry with locally available copy of Secret Detection [analyzer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers) images.
- Configure certificate checking of packages (optional).

GitLab Runner has a [default `pull policy` of `always`](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/docker.html#using-the-always-pull-policy),
meaning the runner tries to pull Docker images from the GitLab container registry even if a local
copy is available. The GitLab Runner [`pull_policy` can be set to `if-not-present`](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/docker.html#using-the-if-not-present-pull-policy)
in an offline environment if you prefer using only locally available Docker images. However, we
recommend keeping the pull policy setting to `always` if not in an offline environment, as this
enables the use of updated scanners in your CI/CD pipelines.

### Make GitLab Secret Detection analyzer image available inside your Docker registry

Import the following default Secret Detection analyzer images from `registry.gitlab.com` into your
[local Docker container registry](../../packages/container_registry/index.md):

```plaintext
registry.gitlab.com/security-products/secret-detection:3
```

The process for importing Docker images into a local offline Docker registry depends on
**your network security policy**. Please consult your IT staff to find an accepted and approved
process by which external resources can be imported or temporarily accessed. These scanners are [periodically updated](../vulnerabilities/index.md#vulnerability-scanner-maintenance)
with new definitions, and you may be able to make occasional updates on your own.

For details on saving and transporting Docker images as a file, see Docker's documentation on
[`docker save`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/save/), [`docker load`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/load/),
[`docker export`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/export/), and [`docker import`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/import/).

### Set Secret Detection CI/CD variables to use the local Secret Detection analyzer container image

Add the following configuration to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. You must replace
`SECURE_ANALYZERS_PREFIX` to refer to your local Docker container registry:

```yaml
include:
  - template: Security/Secret-Detection.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  SECURE_ANALYZERS_PREFIX: "localhost:5000/analyzers"
```

The Secret Detection job should now use the local copy of the Secret Detection analyzer Docker image to scan your code and generate
security reports without requiring internet access.

#### If support for Custom Certificate Authorities are needed

Support for custom certificate authorities was introduced in the following versions.

| Analyzer | Version |
| -------- | ------- |
| secrets | [v3.0.0](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/secrets/-/releases/v3.0.0) |

To trust a custom Certificate Authority, set the `ADDITIONAL_CA_CERT_BUNDLE` variable to the bundle
of CA certs that you want to trust in the SAST environment. The `ADDITIONAL_CA_CERT_BUNDLE` value should contain the [text representation of the X.509 PEM public-key certificate](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7468#section-5.1). For example, to configure this value in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, use the following:

```yaml
variables:
  ADDITIONAL_CA_CERT_BUNDLE: |
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      MIIGqTCCBJGgAwIBAgIQI7AVxxVwg2kch4d56XNdDjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQsFADCB
      ...
      jWgmPqF3vUbZE0EyScetPJquRFRKIesyJuBFMAs=
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

The `ADDITIONAL_CA_CERT_BUNDLE` value can also be configured as a [custom variable in the UI](../../../ci/variables/index.md#custom-cicd-variables), either as a `file`, which requires the path to the certificate, or as a variable, which requires the text representation of the certificate.

## Troubleshooting

### Getting warning message `gl-secret-detection-report.json: no matching files`

For information on this, see the [general Application Security troubleshooting section](../../../ci/pipelines/job_artifacts.md#error-message-no-files-to-upload).

### Error: `Couldn't run the gitleaks command: exit status 2`

If a pipeline is triggered from a Merge Request containing 60 commits while the `GIT_DEPTH` variable
is set to 50 (a [project default](../../../ci/pipelines/settings.md#limit-the-number-of-changes-fetched-during-clone)),
the Secret Detection job fails as the clone is not deep enough to contain all of the
relevant commits.

To confirm this as the cause of the error, set the
[logging level](../../application_security/secret_detection/index.md#logging-level) to `debug`, then
rerun the pipeline. The logs should look similar to the following example. The text "object not
found" is a symptom of this error.

```plaintext
ERRO[2020-11-18T18:05:52Z] object not found
[ERRO] [secrets] [2020-11-18T18:05:52Z] ▶ Couldn't run the gitleaks command: exit status 2
[ERRO] [secrets] [2020-11-18T18:05:52Z] ▶ Gitleaks analysis failed: exit status 2
```

To resolve the issue, set the [`GIT_DEPTH` CI/CD variable](../../../ci/runners/configure_runners.md#shallow-cloning)
to a higher value. To apply this only to the Secret Detection job, the following can be added to
your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

```yaml
secret_detection:
  variables:
    GIT_DEPTH: 100
```
