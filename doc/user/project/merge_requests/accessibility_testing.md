# Accessibility testing **(FREE)**

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/25144) in GitLab 12.8.

If your application offers a web interface and you are using
[GitLab CI/CD](../../../ci/index.md), you can quickly determine the accessibility
impact of pending code changes.

## Overview

GitLab uses [pa11y](https://pa11y.org/), a free and open source tool for
measuring the accessibility of web sites, and has built a simple
[CI job template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Verify/Accessibility.gitlab-ci.yml).
This job outputs accessibility violations, warnings, and notices for each page
analyzed to a file called `accessibility`.

From [GitLab 14.5](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/73309), the version of `pa11y` uses
[WCAG 2.1 rules](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#new-features-in-wcag-2-1), which may report more issues.

## Accessibility merge request widget

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/39425) in GitLab 13.0 behind the disabled [feature flag](../../../administration/feature_flags.md) `:accessibility_report_view`.
> - [Feature Flag removed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217372) in GitLab 13.1.

In addition to the report artifact that is created, GitLab will also show the
Accessibility Report in the merge request widget area:

## Configure Accessibility Testing

This example shows how to run [pa11y](https://pa11y.org/)
on your code with GitLab CI/CD using the [GitLab Accessibility Docker image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ci-cd/accessibility).

For GitLab 12.9 and later, to define the `a11y` job, you must
[include](../../../ci/yaml/index.md#includetemplate) the
[`Accessibility.gitlab-ci.yml` template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Verify/Accessibility.gitlab-ci.yml)
included with your GitLab installation, as shown below.

Add the following to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

```yaml
stages:
  - accessibility

variables:
  a11y_urls: "https://about.gitlab.com https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in"

include:
  - template: "Verify/Accessibility.gitlab-ci.yml"
```

creates an `a11y` job in your CI/CD pipeline, runs
Pa11y against the web pages defined in `a11y_urls`, and builds an HTML report for each.

The report for each URL is saved as an artifact that can be [viewed directly in your browser](../../../ci/pipelines/job_artifacts.md#download-job-artifacts).

A single `gl-accessibility.json` artifact is created and saved along with the individual HTML reports.
It includes report data for all URLs scanned.

NOTE:
For GitLab 12.10 and earlier, the [artifact generated is named `accessibility.json`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ci-cd/accessibility/-/merge_requests/9).

NOTE:
For GitLab versions earlier than 12.9, you can use `include:remote` and use a
link to the [current template in the default branch](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/raw/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Verify/Accessibility.gitlab-ci.yml)

NOTE:
The job definition provided by the template does not support Kubernetes yet.

It is not yet possible to pass configurations into Pa11y via CI configuration. To change anything,
copy the template to your CI file and make the desired edits.
