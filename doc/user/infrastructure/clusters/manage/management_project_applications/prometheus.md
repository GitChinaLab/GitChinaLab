# Install Prometheus with a cluster management project **(FREE)**

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/project-templates/cluster-management/-/merge_requests/5) in GitLab 14.0.

[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/) is an
open-source monitoring and alerting system for supervising your
deployed applications.

Assuming you already have a [Cluster management project](../../../../../user/clusters/management_project.md) created from a
[management project template](../../../../../user/clusters/management_project_template.md), to install Prometheus you should
uncomment this line from your `helmfile.yaml`:

```yaml
  - path: applications/prometheus/helmfile.yaml
```

You can customize the installation of Prometheus by updating the
`applications/prometheus/values.yaml` file in your cluster
management project. Refer to the
[Configuration section](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/prometheus#configuration)
of the Prometheus chart's README for the available configuration options.
