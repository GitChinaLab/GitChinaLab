# Container Registry API **(FREE)**

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/issues/55978) in GitLab 11.8.
> - The use of `CI_JOB_TOKEN` scoped to the current project was [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/49750) in GitLab 13.12.

This is the API documentation of the [GitLab Container Registry](../user/packages/container_registry/index.md).

When the `ci_job_token_scope` feature flag is enabled (it is **disabled by default**), you can use the below endpoints
from a CI/CD job, by passing the `$CI_JOB_TOKEN` variable as the `JOB-TOKEN` header.
The job token will only have access to its own project.

[GitLab administrators with access to the GitLab Rails console](../administration/feature_flags.md)
can opt to enable it.

To enable it:

```ruby
Feature.enable(:ci_job_token_scope)
```

To disable it:

```ruby
Feature.disable(:ci_job_token_scope)
```

## Change the visibility of the Container Registry

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/18792) in GitLab 14.2.

This controls who can view the Container Registry.

```plaintext
PUT /projects/:id/
```

| Attribute | Type | Required | Description |
| --------- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| `id`      | integer/string | yes | The ID or [URL-encoded path of the project](index.md#namespaced-path-encoding) accessible by the authenticated user. |
| `container_registry_access_level` | string | no | The desired visibility of the Container Registry. One of `enabled` (default), `private`, or `disabled`. |

Descriptions of the possible values for `container_registry_access_level`:

- **enabled** (Default): The Container Registry is visible to everyone with access to the project.
If the project is public, the Container Registry is also public. If the project is internal or
private, the Container Registry is also internal or private.

- **private**: The Container Registry is visible only to project members with Reporter role or
higher. This is similar to the behavior of a private project with Container Registry visibility set
to **enabled**.

- **disabled**: The Container Registry is disabled.

See the [Container Registry visibility permissions](../user/packages/container_registry/index.md#container-registry-visibility-permissions)
for more details about the permissions that this setting grants to users.

```shell
curl --request PUT "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/5/" \
     --header 'PRIVATE-TOKEN: <your_access_token>' \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data-raw '{
         "container_registry_access_level": "private"
     }'
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "id": 5,
  "name": "Project 5",
  "container_registry_access_level": "private",
  ...
}
```

This action doesn't delete blobs. To delete them and recycle disk space,
[run the garbage collection](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/maintenance/index.html#removing-unused-layers-not-referenced-by-manifests).

## Delete registry repository tags in bulk

Delete registry repository tags in bulk based on given criteria.

<i class="fa fa-youtube-play youtube" aria-hidden="true"></i>
For an overview, see [Use the Container Registry API to delete all tags except *](https://youtu.be/Hi19bKe_xsg).

```plaintext
DELETE /projects/:id/registry/repositories/:repository_id/tags
```

| Attribute | Type | Required | Description |
| --------- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| `id`      | integer/string | yes | The ID or [URL-encoded path of the project](index.md#namespaced-path-encoding) owned by the authenticated user. |
| `repository_id` | integer | yes | The ID of registry repository. |
| `name_regex` | string | no | The [re2](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) regex of the name to delete. To delete all tags specify `.*`. **Note:** `name_regex` is deprecated in favor of `name_regex_delete`. This field is validated. |
| `name_regex_delete` | string | yes | The [re2](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) regex of the name to delete. To delete all tags specify `.*`. This field is validated. |
| `name_regex_keep` | string | no | The [re2](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) regex of the name to keep. This value overrides any matches from `name_regex_delete`. This field is validated. Note: setting to `.*` results in a no-op. |
| `keep_n` | integer | no | The amount of latest tags of given name to keep. |
| `older_than` | string | no | Tags to delete that are older than the given time, written in human readable form `1h`, `1d`, `1month`. |

This API call performs the following operations:

- It orders all tags by creation date. The creation date is the time of the
  manifest creation, not the time of tag push.
- It removes only the tags matching the given `name_regex_delete` (or deprecated
  `name_regex`), keeping any that match `name_regex_keep`.
- It never removes the tag named `latest`.
- It keeps N latest matching tags (if `keep_n` is specified).
- It only removes tags that are older than X amount of time (if `older_than` is
  specified).
- It schedules the asynchronous job to be executed in the background.

These operations are executed asynchronously and can take time to get executed.
You can run this at most once an hour for a given container repository. This
action doesn't delete blobs. To delete them and recycle disk space,
[run the garbage collection](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/maintenance/index.html#removing-unused-layers-not-referenced-by-manifests).

WARNING:
The number of tags deleted by this API is limited on GitLab.com
because of the scale of the Container Registry there.
If your Container Registry has a large number of tags to delete,
only some of them will be deleted, and you might need to call this API multiple times.
To schedule tags for automatic deletion, use a [cleanup policy](../user/packages/container_registry/index.md#cleanup-policy) instead.

NOTE:
In GitLab 12.4 and later, individual tags are deleted.
For more details, see the [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/15737).

Examples:

1. Remove tag names that are matching the regex (Git SHA), keep always at least 5,
   and remove ones that are older than 2 days:

   ```shell
   curl --request DELETE --data 'name_regex_delete=[0-9a-z]{40}' --data 'keep_n=5' --data 'older_than=2d' \
        --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: <your_access_token>" "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/5/registry/repositories/2/tags"
   ```

1. Remove all tags, but keep always the latest 5:

   ```shell
   curl --request DELETE --data 'name_regex_delete=.*' --data 'keep_n=5' \
        --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: <your_access_token>" "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/5/registry/repositories/2/tags"
   ```

1. Remove all tags, but keep always tags beginning with `stable`:

   ```shell
   curl --request DELETE --data 'name_regex_delete=.*' --data 'name_regex_keep=stable.*' \
        --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: <your_access_token>" "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/5/registry/repositories/2/tags"
   ```

1. Remove all tags that are older than 1 month:

   ```shell
   curl --request DELETE --data 'name_regex_delete=.*' --data 'older_than=1month' \
        --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: <your_access_token>" "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/5/registry/repositories/2/tags"
   ```
