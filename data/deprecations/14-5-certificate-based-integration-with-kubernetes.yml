    [We are deprecating the certificate-based integration with Kubernetes](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/11/15/deprecating-the-cert-based-kubernetes-integration/).
    The timeline of removal of the integration from the product is not yet planned and we will communicate
    more details as they emerge. The certificate-based integration will continue to receive security and
    critical fixes, and features built on the integration will continue to work with supported Kubernetes
    versions. We will provide migration plans in a future iteration. See [the list of features affected by this deprecation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/infrastructure/clusters/#deprecated-features).
    For updates and details, follow this [epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/configure/-/epics/8).

    For a more robust, secure, forthcoming, and reliable integration with Kubernetes, we recommend the use of the
    [Kubernetes Agent](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/) to connect Kubernetes clusters with GitLab.
