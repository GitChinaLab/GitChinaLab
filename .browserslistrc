#
# This list of browsers is a conservative definition, based on
# https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/install/requirements.html#supported-web-browsers
# with the following reasoning:
#
# - We should support the latest ESR of Firefox: 78, because it used quite a lot.
# - We use Edge/Chrome >= 84 because 83 had an annoying bug which would mean we
#   need to polyfill Array.reduce: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1049982
# - Safari 13.1 because it is the current minor version of the previous major version
#

chrome >= 84
