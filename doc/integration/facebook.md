   "&lt;Organization&gt;'s GitLab" or "&lt;Your Name&gt;'s GitLab" or something
   else descriptive.

1. On your GitLab server, open the configuration file.

   For Omnibus package:

   ```shell
   sudo editor /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb
   ```

   For installations from source:

   ```shell
   cd /home/git/gitlab

   sudo -u git -H editor config/gitlab.yml
   ```

1. See [Configure initial settings](omniauth.md#configure-initial-settings) for initial settings.

1. Add the provider configuration:

   For Omnibus package:

   ```ruby
   gitlab_rails['omniauth_providers'] = [
     {
       name: "facebook",
       # label: "Provider name", # optional label for login button, defaults to "Facebook"
       app_id: "YOUR_APP_ID",
       app_secret: "YOUR_APP_SECRET"
     }
   ]
   ```

   For installations from source:

   ```yaml
   - { name: 'facebook',
       # label: 'Provider name', # optional label for login button, defaults to "Facebook"
       app_id: 'YOUR_APP_ID',
       app_secret: 'YOUR_APP_SECRET' }
   ```

1. Change 'YOUR_APP_ID' to the API key from Facebook page in step 10.

1. Change 'YOUR_APP_SECRET' to the API secret from the Facebook page in step 10.

1. Save the configuration file.

1. [Reconfigure](../administration/restart_gitlab.md#omnibus-gitlab-reconfigure) or [restart GitLab](../administration/restart_gitlab.md#installations-from-source) for the changes to take effect if you
   installed GitLab via Omnibus or from source respectively.

On the sign in page there should now be a Facebook icon below the regular sign
in form. Click the icon to begin the authentication process. Facebook asks the
user to sign in and authorize the GitLab application. If everything goes well
the user is returned to GitLab and signed in.
