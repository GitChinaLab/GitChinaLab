# Storage usage quota **(FREE)**

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/13294) in GitLab 12.0.
> - Moved to GitLab Free.

A project's repository has a free storage quota of 10 GB. When a project's repository reaches
the quota it is locked. You cannot push changes to a locked project. To monitor the size of each
repository in a namespace, including a breakdown for each project, you can
[view storage usage](#view-storage-usage). To allow a project's repository to exceed the free quota
you must purchase additional storage. For more details, see [Excess storage usage](#excess-storage-usage).

## View storage usage

You can view storage usage for your project or [namespace](../user/group/#namespaces).

1. Go to your project or namespace:
   - For a project, on the top bar, select **Menu > Projects** and find your project.
   - For a namespace, enter the URL in your browser's toolbar.
1. From the left sidebar, select **Settings > Usage Quotas**.
1. Select the **Storage** tab.

The statistics are displayed. Select any title to view details. The information on this page
is updated every 90 minutes.

If your namespace shows `N/A`, push a commit to any project in the
namespace to recalculate the storage.

## Storage usage statistics

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/68898) project-level graph in GitLab 14.4 [with a flag](../administration/feature_flags.md) named `project_storage_ui`. Disabled by default.
> - Enabled on GitLab.com in GitLab 14.4.
> - Enabled on self-managed in GitLab 14.5.
> - [Feature flag removed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/71270) in GitLab 14.5.

The following storage usage statistics are available to an owner:

- Total namespace storage used: Total amount of storage used across projects in this namespace.
- Total excess storage used: Total amount of storage used that exceeds their allocated storage.
- Purchased storage available: Total storage that has been purchased but is not yet used.

## Excess storage usage

Excess storage usage is the amount that a project's repository exceeds the free storage quota. If no
purchased storage is available the project is locked. You cannot push changes to a locked project.
To unlock a project you must [purchase more storage](../subscriptions/gitlab_com/index.md#purchase-more-storage)
for the namespace. When the purchase is completed, locked projects are automatically unlocked. The
amount of purchased storage available must always be greater than zero.

The **Storage** tab of the **Usage Quotas** page warns you of the following:

- Purchased storage available is running low.
- Projects that are at risk of being locked if purchased storage available is zero.
- Projects that are locked because purchased storage available is zero. Locked projects are
  marked with an information icon (**{information-o}**) beside their name.

### Excess storage example

The following example describes an excess storage scenario for namespace _Example Company_:

| Repository | Storage used | Excess storage | Quota  | Status            |
|------------|--------------|----------------|--------|-------------------|
| Red        | 10 GB        | 0 GB           | 10 GB  | Locked **{lock}** |
| Blue       | 8 GB         | 0 GB           | 10 GB  | Not locked        |
| Green      | 10 GB        | 0 GB           | 10 GB  | Locked **{lock}** |
| Yellow     | 2 GB         | 0 GB           | 10 GB  | Not locked        |
| **Totals** | **30 GB**    | **0 GB**       | -      | -                 |

The Red and Green projects are locked because their repositories have reached the quota. In this
example, no additional storage has yet been purchased.

To unlock the Red and Green projects, 50 GB additional storage is purchased.

Assuming the Green and Red projects' repositories grow past the 10 GB quota, the purchased storage
available decreases. All projects remain unlocked because 40 GB purchased storage is available:
50 GB (purchased storage) - 10 GB (total excess storage used).

| Repository | Storage used | Excess storage | Quota   | Status            |
|------------|--------------|----------------|---------|-------------------|
| Red        | 15 GB        | 5 GB           | 10 GB   | Not locked        |
| Blue       | 14 GB        | 4 GB           | 10 GB   | Not locked        |
| Green      | 11 GB        | 1 GB           | 10 GB   | Not locked        |
| Yellow     | 5 GB         | 0 GB           | 10 GB   | Not locked        |
| **Totals** | **45 GB**    | **10 GB**      | -       | -                 |
