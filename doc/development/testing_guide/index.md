# Testing standards and style guidelines

This document describes various guidelines and best practices for automated
testing of the GitLab project.

It is meant to be an _extension_ of the [Thoughtbot testing
style guide](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/testing-rspec). If
this guide defines a rule that contradicts the Thoughtbot guide, this guide
takes precedence. Some guidelines may be repeated verbatim to stress their
importance.

## Overview

GitLab is built on top of [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), and we're using [RSpec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails#feature-specs) for all
the backend tests, with [Capybara](https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara) for end-to-end integration testing.
On the frontend side, we're using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for JavaScript unit and
integration testing.

Following are two great articles that everyone should read to understand what
automated testing means, and what are its principles:

- [Five Factor Testing](https://madeintandem.com/blog/five-factor-testing/): Why do we need tests?
- [Principles of Automated Testing](https://www.lihaoyi.com/post/PrinciplesofAutomatedTesting.html): Levels of testing. Prioritize tests. Cost of tests.
