# Pipelines for merge requests **(FREE)**

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/issues/15310) in GitLab 11.6.

In a [basic configuration](pipeline_architectures.md#basic-pipelines), GitLab runs a pipeline each time
changes are pushed to a branch.

If you want the pipeline to run jobs **only** on commits associated with a merge request,
you can use *pipelines for merge requests*.

These pipelines are labeled as `detached` in the UI, and they do not have access to [protected variables](../variables/index.md#protect-a-cicd-variable).
Otherwise, these pipelines are the same as other pipelines.

Pipelines for merge requests can run when you:

- Create a new merge request.
- Commit changes to the source branch for the merge request.
- Select the **Run pipeline** button from the **Pipelines** tab in the merge request.

If you use this feature with [merge when pipeline succeeds](../../user/project/merge_requests/merge_when_pipeline_succeeds.md),
pipelines for merge requests take precedence over other pipelines.

## Prerequisites

To enable pipelines for merge requests:

- Your repository must be a GitLab repository, not an
  [external repository](../ci_cd_for_external_repos/index.md).
- You must have the Developer [role](../../user/permissions.md)
  to run a pipeline for merge requests.

## Configure pipelines for merge requests

To configure pipelines for merge requests, you must configure your [CI/CD configuration file](../yaml/index.md).
To do this, you can use [`rules`](#use-rules-to-run-pipelines-for-merge-requests) or [`only/except`](#use-only-or-except-to-run-pipelines-for-merge-requests).

### Use `rules` to run pipelines for merge requests

GitLab recommends that you use the `rules` keyword, which is available in
[`workflow:rules` templates](../yaml/workflow.md#workflowrules-templates).

### Use `only` or `except` to run pipelines for merge requests

You can use the `only/except` keywords. However, with this method, you must specify `only: - merge_requests` for each job.

In the following example, the pipeline contains a `test` job that is configured to run on merge requests.
The `build` and `deploy` jobs don't have the `only: - merge_requests` keyword,
so they don't run on merge requests.

```yaml
build:
  stage: build
  script: ./build
  only:
    - main

test:
  stage: test
  script: ./test
  only:
    - merge_requests

deploy:
  stage: deploy
  script: ./deploy
  only:
    - main
```

#### Exclude specific jobs

When you use `only: [merge_requests]`, only jobs with
that keyword are run in the context of a merge request. No other jobs run.

However, you can invert this behavior and have all of your jobs run except
for one or two. For example, you might have a pipeline with jobs `A`, `B`, and `C`, and you want:

- All pipelines to always run `A` and `B`.
- `C` to run only for merge requests.

To achieve this outcome, configure your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file as follows:

```yaml
.only-default: &only-default
  only:
    - main
    - merge_requests
    - tags

A:
  <<: *only-default
  script:
    - ...

B:
  <<: *only-default
  script:
    - ...

C:
  script:
    - ...
  only:
    - merge_requests
```

- `A` and `B` always run, because they get the `only` rule to execute in all cases.
- `C` only runs for merge requests. It doesn't run for any pipeline
  except a merge request pipeline.

In this example, you don't have to add the `only` rule to all of your jobs to make
them always run. You can use this format to set up a Review App, which helps to
save resources.

#### Exclude specific branches

Branch refs use this format: `refs/heads/my-feature-branch`.
Merge request refs use this format: `refs/merge-requests/:iid/head`.

Because of this difference, the following configuration does not work as expected:

```yaml
# Does not exclude a branch named "docs-my-fix"!
test:
  only: [merge_requests]
  except: [/^docs-/]
```

Instead, use the
[`$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME` predefined environment
variable](../variables/predefined_variables.md) in
combination with
[`only:variables`](../yaml/index.md#onlyvariables--exceptvariables) to
accomplish this behavior:

```yaml
test:
  only: [merge_requests]
  except:
    variables:
      - $CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME =~ /^docs-/
```

## Run pipelines in the parent project for merge requests from a forked project **(PREMIUM)**

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217451) in GitLab 13.3.
> - [Moved](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/01/26/new-gitlab-product-subscription-model/) to GitLab Premium in 13.9.

By default, external contributors who work in forks can't create pipelines in the
parent project. When a merge request that comes from a fork triggers a pipeline:

- The pipeline is created and runs in the fork (source) project, not the parent (target) project.
- The pipeline uses the fork project's CI/CD configuration and resources.

If a pipeline runs in a fork, a **fork** badge appears for the pipeline in the merge request.

Sometimes parent project members want the pipeline to run in the parent
project. They may want to ensure that the post-merge pipeline passes in the parent project.
For example, a fork project could try to use a corrupted runner that doesn't execute
test scripts properly, but reports a passed pipeline. Reviewers in the parent project
could mistakenly trust the merge request because it passed a faked pipeline.

Parent project members with at least the [Developer role](../../user/permissions.md)
can create pipelines in the parent project for merge requests
from a forked project. In the merge request, go to the **Pipelines** tab and select
**Run pipeline**.

WARNING:
Fork merge requests can contain malicious code that tries to steal secrets in the
parent project when the pipeline runs, even before merge. As a reviewer, you must carefully
check the changes in the merge request before triggering the pipeline. GitLab shows
a warning that you must accept before you can trigger the pipeline.

## Predefined variables available for pipelines for merge requests

When you use pipelines for merge requests, [additional predefined variables](../variables/predefined_variables.md#predefined-variables-for-merge-request-pipelines) are available to the CI/CD jobs.
These variables contain information from the associated merge request, so that you can
integrate your job with the [GitLab Merge Request API](../../api/merge_requests.md).

## Troubleshooting

### Two pipelines created when pushing to a merge request

If you are experiencing duplicated pipelines when using `rules`, take a look at
the [important differences between `rules` and `only`/`except`](../jobs/job_control.md#avoid-duplicate-pipelines),
which helps you get your starting configuration correct.

If you are seeing two pipelines when using `only/except`, please see the caveats
related to using `only/except` above (or, consider moving to `rules`).

In [GitLab 13.7 and later](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/201845),
you can add `workflow:rules` to [switch from branch pipelines to merge request pipelines](../yaml/workflow.md#switch-between-branch-pipelines-and-merge-request-pipelines).
After a merge request is open on the branch, the pipeline switches to a merge request pipeline.

### Two pipelines created when pushing an invalid CI configuration file

Pushing to a branch with an invalid CI configuration file can trigger
the creation of two types of failed pipelines. One pipeline is a failed merge request
pipeline, and the other is a failed branch pipeline, but both are caused by the same
invalid configuration.
