# Dependency Scanning Analyzers **(ULTIMATE)**

Dependency Scanning relies on underlying third-party tools that are wrapped into
what we call "Analyzers". An analyzer is a
[dedicated project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers)
that wraps a particular tool to:

- Expose its detection logic.
- Handle its execution.
- Convert its output to the common format.

This is achieved by implementing the [common API](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common).

Dependency Scanning supports the following official analyzers:

- [`bundler-audit`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/bundler-audit)
- [`gemnasium`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium)
- [`gemnasium-maven`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven)
- [`gemnasium-python`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python)
- [`retire.js`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/retire.js)

The analyzers are published as Docker images, which Dependency Scanning uses
to launch dedicated containers for each analysis.

Dependency Scanning is pre-configured with a set of **default images** that are
maintained by GitLab, but users can also integrate their own **custom images**.

WARNING:
The `bundler-audit` analyzer is deprecated and will be removed in GitLab 15.0 since it duplicates the functionality of the `gemnasium` analyzer. For more information, read the [deprecation announcement](../../../update/deprecations.md#deprecation-of-bundler-audit-dependency-scanning-tool).

## Official default analyzers

Any custom change to the official analyzers can be achieved by using a
[CI/CD variable in your `.gitlab-ci.yml`](index.md#customizing-the-dependency-scanning-settings).

### Using a custom Docker mirror

You can switch to a custom Docker registry that provides the official analyzer
images under a different prefix. For instance, the following instructs Dependency
Scanning to pull `my-docker-registry/gl-images/gemnasium`
instead of `registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium`.
In `.gitlab-ci.yml` define:

```yaml
include:
  template: Security/Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  SECURE_ANALYZERS_PREFIX: my-docker-registry/gl-images
```

This configuration requires that your custom registry provides images for all
the official analyzers.

### Disable specific analyzers

You can select the official analyzers you don't want to run. Here's how to disable
`bundler-audit` and `gemnasium` analyzers.
In `.gitlab-ci.yml` define:

```yaml
include:
  template: Security/Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  DS_EXCLUDED_ANALYZERS: "bundler-audit, gemnasium"
```

### Disabling default analyzers

Setting `DS_EXCLUDED_ANALYZERS` to a list of the official analyzers disables them.
In `.gitlab-ci.yml` define:

```yaml
include:
  template: Security/Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  DS_EXCLUDED_ANALYZERS: "gemnasium, gemnasium-maven, gemnasium-python, bundler-audit, retire.js"
```

This is used when one totally relies on [custom analyzers](#custom-analyzers).

## Custom analyzers

You can provide your own analyzers by
defining CI jobs in your CI configuration. For consistency, you should suffix your custom Dependency
Scanning jobs with `-dependency_scanning`. Here's how to add a scanning job that's based on the
Docker image `my-docker-registry/analyzers/nuget` and generates a Dependency Scanning report
`gl-dependency-scanning-report.json` when `/analyzer run` is executed. Define the following in
`.gitlab-ci.yml`:

```yaml
nuget-dependency_scanning:
  image:
    name: "my-docker-registry/analyzers/nuget"
  script:
    - /analyzer run
  artifacts:
    reports:
      dependency_scanning: gl-dependency-scanning-report.json
```

The [Security Scanner Integration](../../../development/integrations/secure.md) documentation explains how to integrate custom security scanners into GitLab.

## Analyzers data

The following table lists the data available for each official analyzer.

- ✓ => we have that data
- ⚠ => we have that data, but it's partially reliable, or we need to extract that data from unstructured content
- 𐄂 => we don't have that data, or it would need to develop specific or inefficient/unreliable logic to obtain it.

The values provided by these tools are heterogeneous, so they are sometimes
normalized into common values (for example, `severity`, `confidence`, etc).
